Welcome to tango-simlib's documentation!
============================================

tango-simlib is a library that aids the data-driven development of TANGO device
simulators. It aims to make it easy to develop basic simulators while making it
possible to implement more complex simulators.

In addition to the simulated device interface, a separate TANGO simulation-control
interface is generated, allowing the simulator to be manipulated via a back-channel
to simulate e.g. failure conditions on the simulated device interface.
